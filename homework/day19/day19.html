    <h1>What is programming?</h1>
    <img src = "./ProgrammingIllustration.png" width="500px">
    <p> Programming refers to a <br>technological process for telling a computer which tasks to<br> perform in order to solve
        problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration <br>between humans and computers, in which humans create
        instructions for a computer<br> to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.
