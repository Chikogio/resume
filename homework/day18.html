    <h1>Christmas</h1>
    <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as
        a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the
        Christian liturgical year, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity
        Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates
        on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by
        a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of
        the holiday season organized around it.</p>
